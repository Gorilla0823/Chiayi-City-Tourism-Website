It is quite spectacular. Stone monuments with stone turtles can be seen everywhere in China, but it is rare in Taiwan. There are only a few pieces left in Tainan and other places. It is not only rare and expensive. More importantly, this monument has drawn a section of Taiwan's important history--Lin Shuang Wen's Incident, especially Zhuluo County's event, which was named ""Chiayi"" by the emperor. It is the only special case given by the emperor for the name of the whole Taiwan. In the 51st year of Emperor Qianlong (1786), Lin Shuangwen killed the soldiers in Changhua, killed Changhua County, and captured Zhuluo (Chiayi County) and Fengshan County in the south. As Taiwan's general soldier Chai Daji fought bravely, he not only defended Tainan Fucheng, but also recovered Zhuluo County in the first month of Qianlong 52 (1787). After Lin Shuangwen's reorganization, he continued to besiege Zhuluo City. The war was fierce and the situation was in jeopardy. In October of the same year, Emperor Fu Kangan, who was sent to perform his military exploits, led his troops to reinforce Taiwan. He defeated Lin Shuangwen and lifted the encirclement of Zhuluocheng. After the event, the Luocheng army and the people defended the city with enthusiasm, and the name of the special family was changed to Chiayi. In the 53rd year of Emperor Qianlong (1788), the emperor made ten works of stone tablets and turtles to celebrate the battle of Fu Kang'an."*°®¶©¬Ó«Ò±s»sªº½Ç´­¥\¸OºÖ±d¦w¬ö¥\¸Oªº¦W®ð«Ü¤j,±N¥Û¸O½Ý¥ß©ó¥ÛÀt¤W,¬Û·í§§Æ[,¦b¤¤°ê¨ì³B¥i¥H¨£¨ì¥Î¥ÛÀt§,¬°¥x°òªº¥Û¸O,¤£¹L¦b¥xÆW«o¬O¨u¨£ªº,¥u¦³¥x«nµ¥¦a¯d¦³´X¶ô,¤£¥u¬Oª«µ}¬°¶Q,§ó­«­nªº,¦¹¸O²o¤Þ¥X¤,¬q¥xÆW­«­nªº¾ú¥v ¢w ªL²n¤å¨ÆÅÜ,¤×¨ä¬O½ÑÃ¹¿¤¦]¦¹¨Æ¥ó©^¬Ó«Ò½ç¦W¬°¡u¹Å¸q¡v,¬°¥þ¥x¦a¦W°ß¤,¥Ñ¬Ó«Ò¿Ë½çªº¯S¨Ò¡C°®¶© 51 ¦~ (1786) ,ªL²n¤å¦b¹ü¤ÆÁ|§L°_¨Æ,±þ¦º¹ü¤Æª¾¿¤,«n¤U§ð³´½ÑÃ¹ ( ¹Å¸q ) ¿¤¤Î»ñ¤s¿¤,¤,®É¥þ¥xÄÌ¶Ã¡C¥Ñ©ó¥xÆWÁ`§L®ã¤j¬ö¾Ä«i§,¾Ô,¤£¦ý«O½Ã¦í¥x«n©²«°,¤S©ó°®¶© 52 ¦~ (1787) ¥¿¤ë¦¬´_½ÑÃ¹¿¤«°¡C¦ÓªL²n¤å³¡²³¦b­«¾ã«á,Ä~Äò³ò§ð½ÑÃ¹«°,¾Ô¨ÆºG¯P,±¡¶Õ§Ä§Ä¥i¦M¡C¦P¦~¤Q¤ë,°®¶©½Õ¬£¼i¥ß¾Ô¥\ªººÖ±d¦w±N­x²v§L¼W´©¥xÆW,ªG±NªL²n¤åÀ»±Ñ,¸Ñ°£¤F½ÑÃ¹«°¤§³ò¡C¨Æ«á¤w½ÑÃ¹«°­x¥Á¦u«°¸q«i¥i¹Å,¯S®a¦a¦W§ï¬°¹Å¸q¡C°®¶© 53 ¦~ (1788) ¬Ó«Ò±s»s¤Q®y¬ö¤u¸O¥Û»PÀt®y,¥H½Ç´­ºÖ±d¦w¤§¾Ô¥\*886-5-2294593**600*122 Minquan Road, East District, Chiayi City*********https://travel.chiayi.gov.tw/upload/travels/37af0c6f3720a21c8306ab2106ff2128.jpg*ºÖ±d¦w¬ö¥\¸O******376600000A*120.464386*23.4836643**1***http://www.ttvs.cy.edu.tw/kcc/934chia/fu.htm*2018/12/19 15:51

C1_376600000A_000055*Chiayi Shrine Hand Water House*All day*"The Chiayi Shrine ""Hands Water House"", which has been shut down for nearly half a century, has regained its water! Located in the handicraft house opposite the Chiayi City Historical Site Museum, the history of Chiayi Shrine originated in 1911. In order to promote the Japanese national Shinto and promote the movement of the emperor, the Chiayi Hall actively established the Chiayi Shrine. The Chiayi Shrine is divided into two generations. The first generation shrine was opened in 1915. Its position is right in front of the current shooting tower. At that time, the second generation of shrines was built because of the large number of worshippers and the lack of space. The overall heritage includes the first-generation shrine relics, ceremonial wares, hand-water houses, rest places (collections), and the museums and social affairs offices. The second generation of Chiayi Shrine's hand water house was opened in 1945. It is an independent four-column building with an octagonal overflow trough in the center. The trough is built with a stone plate and is equipped with a long handle water spoon to provide the pilgrim with hand washing and gargle. The effect of cleansing the net. In order to protect the monuments, the tap water is connected and the induction facility is installed to automatically discharge the water, so that visitors can experience the steps of the net body squatting when visiting the Japanese shrine. I hope that after the rehydration, more people will visit the Chiayi City Historical Site Museum, and the history and culture of the shrine will be More understanding. Set the commentary card in the hand water house to let the visitors know the steps of using the hand water house: (1) Take the long handle with the right hand to take the water (only once for each person)"*°±¤ô°®²U±Nªñ¥b¥,¬öªº¹Å¸q¯«ªÀ¡u¤â¤ôªÙ¡v´_¤ô¤F¡I¦ì©ó¹Å¸q¥«¥vÂÝ¸ê®ÆÀ]¹ï­±ªº¤â¤ôªÙ,¹Å¸q¯«ªÀªº¾ú¥v·½¦Û1911¦~,·í¦~¤é¤H¬°¤F´£­Ò¤é¥»°ê®a¯«¹D,±À®i¬Ó¥Á¤Æªº¹B°Ê,¹Å¸qÆU¿n·¥Äw«Ø¹Å¸q¯«ªÀ¡C¹Å¸q¯«ªÀ¤À¬°¨â¥N,²Ä¤,¥N¯«ªÀ©ó1915¦~±Ò¥Î,¨ä¦ì¸m¦b²{¦b®g¤é¶ðªº¥k«e¤è,·í®É¦]°Ñ«ô¤H¼Æ¦h,ªÅ¶¡¤£¼Å¨Ï¥Î¦Ó¥t«Ø²Ä¤G¥N¯«ªÀ¡C¾ãÅé¥jÂÝ½d³ò¥]§t²Ä¤,¥N¯«ªÀ¿ò¸ñ¡B²½¾¹®w¡B¤â¤ôªÙ¡B¥ð¾Í©Ò¡]°Ñ¶°©Ò¡^¡BÂNÀ]¤ÎªÀ°È©Òµ¥ªþÄÝÀ]©Ò¡C²Ä¤G¥N¹Å¸q¯«ªÀªº¤â¤ôªÙ©ó1945¦~±Ò¥Î,¬°¿W¥ßªº¥|¬W®x«Ø¿v,¤¤¥¡¦³¤K¨¤§Î·¸¤ô¼Ñ,¼Ñ¤º¸m¥Û½L¤,¤f,°t¸mªø¬`¤ô¤c,´£¨Ñ°Ñ«ôªÌ¬~¤â©Mº¤¤f¤§¥Î,¥H¹F¨ì²b¨­²b¤ßªº®ÄªG¡C¬°¤F«OÅ,¥jÂÝ,¤Þ±µ¦Û¨Ó¤ô¨Ã¥[¸Ë·PÀ³³]¬I¦Û°Ê¥X¤ô,Åý¹C«ÈÅéÅç¨ì³X¤é¥»¯«ªÀ®Éªº²b¨­º¤¤f¨BÆJ,§Æ±æ´_¤ô«áÅý§ó¦h¥Á²³°ÑÆ[¹Å¸q¥«¥vÂÝ¸ê®ÆÀ]®É,¹ï¯«ªÀªº¾ú¥v¤å¤Æ¦³§ó¦hªº»{ÃÑ¡C¤â¤ôªÙ¤º³]¸m¸Ñ»¡µPÅý°ÑÆ[¥Á²³»{ÃÑ¤â¤ôªÙ¨Ï¥Î¨BÆJ¡G(1)¥H¥k¤â®³ªø¬`¤c¨ú¤ô¡]¨C¤H¥u¨ú¤,¦¸*886-5-2294593**600*122 Minquan Road, East District, Chiayi City*********https://travel.chiayi.gov.tw/upload/travels/5bb4a5d5628afe8ed23d22537b3b20e5.jpg*¹Å¸q¯«ªÀ¤â¤ôªÙ******376600000A*120.4676568*23.4817242**1****2018/12/19 18:58

It was renovated several times after the earthquake. It was rebuilt in the 62nd year of the Republic of China. It was completed in the Republic of China in 1967 (1978). The house is golden glazed tile, and the temple is stunned. Magnificent, the walls and beams of the temple are dark brown, which is different from the color of the temple. It is more stable and solemn. The main hall is dedicated to the Buddha statue of Sakyamuni, and it is surrounded by the saints and the affair of Ananda. The environment is quiet. The gongs and drums of the morning bell and the sacred voices linger, so ""Mito Xiaozhong"" is one of the eight scenic spots in Chiayi. In front of the Amitabha Temple is the Bazhang River. The original Yidu Suspension Bridge spans over the stream. The length of the suspension bridge is 500 meters. It is seen by the distant eagle and over the water. Therefore, it is called Luqiao, the past eight. The rapids of the Zhangxi River surged, and there was a scene of Luqiao Bridge Waves. Nowadays, the suspension bridge has been destroyed and dismantled. It is no longer the same. On the left side of the temple gate, there is still a Bazhangxi Yidu Memorial Monument, which is included in the third level. Ancient monuments, but unfortunately the inscriptions are incomprehensible. There is a Yimin Tower next to the Yidu Monument. This tower was built in 1938. There are 503 people in the tower of the Zhaozhong Yizhong People and 19 members of the Zhongyigong (including a righteous dog)."*«ÕÀRªº¦x¼q¬ü´º«Ø©ó²M°®¶©17¦~¡]1752¡^,¾ú¸g¾_®`¤ô±w¦Ó¼Æ¦¸¾ã­×,©ó¥Á°ê62¦~¥þ¦x¿³¤u­««Ø,¦Ü¥Á°ê67¦~¡]1978¡^µ¤¤u,«Î¦t¬°ª÷¶À¦â¯[¼þ¥Ë,¦x®eÄÞµM§§ÄR,·µ¦tÀð¾À¡B¼Ù¬W¬°²`¯ù¦â,¤£¦P©ó¤,¯ë¦x·µ¥Î¦â,§óÅãÃ­­«µÂ¿p,¥¿·µ¨Ñ©^ÄÀ­{¦È¥§¦ò¸t¹³,¨Ã¥H­{¸­´LªÌ¤ÎªüÃø´LªÌ³­ªÁ¥ª¥k,Àô¹Ò²M«Õ,¼Ç¹ª±áÄÁ¡B±ë­µÂ·Â¶,¦]¦¹ &ldquo;À±ªû¾åÄÁ&rdquo;¨É¦³¹Å¸q¤K´º¤§¤,ªº¬üÅA¡CÀ±ªû¦x«e¬°¤K´x·Ë,­ì¦³¸q´ç¦Q¾ô¾î¸ó·Ë¤ô¤§¤W,¦Q¾ôªø«×500¤½¤Ø,¥H¨ä»·±æ­¸ÆO­âªÅ¡B¶V¤ô¦Ó¹L,¬G¤S¦³&ldquo;ÆO¾ô&rdquo;¤§ºÙ,©¹©õ¤K´x·Ë«æ¬y´éªi,­P¦³&ldquo;ÆO¾ôÆ[®ö&rdquo;¤§´º,¦p¤µ¦Q¾ô¤w·´·l©î°£,¤£´_©õÆ[,¦x°|¤jªù¥ª°¼¤s©Y¤W¤´¥ß¦³¤K´x·Ë¸q´ç°O©À¸O,¦C¤J¤T¯Å¥jÂÝ,¥i±¤¸O¤å¤w´ó¨SÃø¿ë¡C¦Ó¦b¸q´ç¸O®Ç¦³®y¸q¥Á¶ð,¦¹¶ð«Ø¤_1938¦~,¶ð¤¤¦XªÁ¬L©¾¸q¥Á¤½503¤H¤Î©¾¸q¤½19¤H¿ò°©¡]¨ä¤¤§t¤,¥u¸q¤ü¡^,¬Ò¬O¬°¦a¤è¨ú¸q®î*886-5-2224203***1 Mito Road, East District, Chiayi City*********https://travel.chiayi.gov.tw/upload/travels/8bcf3f670b0b646f3425bb72cf6b063d.JPG*À±ªû¦x******376600000A*120.470015*23.4626906**1****2018/12/19 15:23

The February 28th incident that occurred in 1947 was a sad historical tragedy. At that time, the Central Government and the Taiwan Provincial Government regarded the February 28 incident as a taboo, obstructing this monument, but at the time, Zhang Boya and the people insisted. Next, in 1989, the monument was built in Chiayi, becoming the first [2:28 Monument] in China. This white three-dimensional pyramid monument is lined with three inscriptions, namely the monument, the spirit of the monument and a brief history of the 228 incident. I hope to remember the lessons of history, to walk out of tragic feelings, to respect life, and to pursue justice. . After the Second World War, Taiwan was separated from Japanese rule and thought that it would be possible to live a free and democratic life. Unexpectedly, the Chinese regime accepted Taiwan, and Chen Yi's officers and men were corrupt and incompetent, and the privilege was rampant. In addition, the post-war economic system was ruined and the prices were soaring. The lives of the Taiwanese people were hard, and they complained and screamed. On February 27, 1947, officials in the Dadaotun, Taipei, smuggled illicit cigarettes, violently wounded the female traders, and then shot and killed the protesters.

At present, the first curatorial theme of the Vision Pavilion is ¡§Looking for the Heart of Taocheng¡¨, presenting the past and present life of Chiayi Station, the introduction of Chiayi¡¦s historical evolution, and the simulation route of Tiegao. Using AR to augment the reality, the public will watch the 3D station map with a tablet computer. . &nbsp;The Vision Pavilion is also the railway elevated community workstation in Chiayi City. The display content will be updated with the progress of the railway elevated detail design, providing engineering information, and also holding a series of public participation seminars, briefings and workshops.

You can see it at night, and welcome the public to take a stroll to the top, and enjoy the unicorns for free."*¹Å¸q¥«³»ÉÜ¨½Àô«O¥ÍºA§ï³y¦h¦~¦³¦¨,±N¥x¿}ÂÂÅK¹DÂà«¬Àç³y¦¨ªÀ°Ï¦Û¦æ¨®¹D,¨â°¼¥úÄú¾ð¤W³B³B¥i¨£¦¨¸sªº¿W¨¤¥P,¥O¤HÅå³ß¤£¤w¡I¿W¨¤¥P´_¨|¤£®e©ö,³»ÉÜªÀ°Ï³z¹L§ïµ½¤ô½è¡BÀô¹Ò¡B®âºØ¥úÃ¾¾ð¹D¤Î«Ø¸m¦Û¦æ¨®¹D,Àç³y¾A©y©~¦íÀô¹Ò,§â¿W¨¤¥P§ä¦^¨Ó¡C¨C¦~5¤ë¤¤¦¯,¿W¨¤¥P³£·|¦Ð¤Æ±q¤gÄ[¤¤¥X¨Ó,´M§ä¦ñ«QÁc­l¤l®],¼Æ¦Ê°¦¿W¨¤¥P½L½õ¦b¥úÃ¾¾ð¤W,ÅÜ´«¦UºØ«º¶Õ,¬Æ¦Ü¨¤¤O¤¬°«,´º¶H¥O¤HÅå³ß¡C¿W¨¤¥P¦³¡uÅK¥ÒªZ¤h¡v¬üºÙ,¡u´M§ä¿W¨¤¥PªºÂÜ¸ñ¡v¬¡°Ê,¨C¦~±q5¤ë¤¤¦¯¨ì6¤ë©³,Åwªï¥Á²³Äâ®a±a²²¤,¦P«e©¹,Åý«Ä¤l±µÄ²¤j¦ÛµM,¤]­«·Å¨à®É¦^¾Ð¡C­È±o¤,´£ªº¬O,¹Å¸q¥«¬F©²106¦~Á|¿ì¡u²Ä¤,©¡ª÷µP¹A§øÄvÁÉ¡v,³Ì«á¥Ñ¡u³»ÉÜªÀ°Ï¡v©Þ±oÀYÄw,Àò¿ï¬°ª÷µP¹A§ø¡C¡·«ç»ò¥h¡H¥Ñ¥x¿}ÂÂÅK¹DÂà«¬Àç³y¦Ó¦¨ªºªÀ°Ï¦Û¦æ¨®¹D¬O¶}©ñªÅ¶¡,¥Ñ¸q±Ðµó³»ÉÜ¨½ªø¿ì¤½³B¹ï­±ªº585«Ñ¶i¤J,ªÀ°Ï¦Û¦æ¨®¹D¨â°¼¥úÄú¾ð¤W§¡¥i¨£¦¨¸s¿W¨¤¥P,¥Õ¤Ñ¡B±ß¤W³£¬Ý±o¨£,Åwªï¥Á²³¦³ªÅ¨ì³»ÉÜº©¨B,§K¶OªY½à¿W¨¤¥P¡C*886-5-2765298***538 Yizhijiao Street, Dingzhuang, Chiayi City*********https://travel.chiayi.gov.tw/upload/travels/5748a7cb268a6f851d656f4af92bbc5d.jpg*³»ÉÜªÀ°Ï******376600000A*120.458053*23.498645**1****2018/12/19 23:03
